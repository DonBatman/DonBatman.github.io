Overview 🔗
The Land Claim mod is designed for Luanti, allowing players to claim chunks of land within the game world. Once claimed, these areas provide protection against various natural elements such as lava, water, and fire from other players as well as tnt and other explosions. The mod includes functionality for claiming, unclaiming, checking ownership, and managing access permissions. A chunk is 16 x 16 nodes. The claim is 150 nodes high.
<br><br>
Features 🔗
>br>
Chunk Claiming: Players can claim chunks to prevent others from altering them.
<br>
Lava, Water, and Fire Protection: Stops the spread of these elements into claimed areas from adjacent unprotected land.
<br>
Access Management: Owners can grant or revoke other players' access to their claimed chunks.
<br>
Fence: When you hold a stick a fence appears to show you where the chunk is. A blue fence means it is free land. Orange means that you own the chunk. Red means that the chunk is owned by another player.
